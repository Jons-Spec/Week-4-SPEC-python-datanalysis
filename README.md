# Week 4 SPEC level 2 advanced python

Was sick the first 2 days so was a bit behinde when I started.
Made it in a ipynb file so you can run the code in different blocks.
Took some datasets from Kaggle.
Decided to use the smaller dataset since it had more interestting data for plotting, while the bigger one was more for performance testing.
